Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. If administrators could determine the factors that influence increases in the percentage of alumni donation, they might be able to implement policies that could lead to increased revenues. Research shows that students who are more satisfied with their contact with teachers are more likely to graduate. As a result, one might suspect that smaller class sizes and lower student-faculty ratios might lead to a higher percentage of satisfied graduates, which in turn might lead to increases in the percentage of alumni donations. Similarly, to find various other factors that can affect the alumni donation rate, we have taken the dataset of 48 national universities (Americaâ€™s Best Colleges, Year 2000 Edition) and have done exploratory data analysis and fit linear regression models to understand implemented various linear regression model to find best model which can answer this question.
